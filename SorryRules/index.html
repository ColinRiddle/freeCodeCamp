            <article>
             <p><strong>Sorry!</strong> is a board game that is based on the ancient Indian cross and circle game Pachisi. Players move their three or four pieces around the board, attempting to get all of their pieces "home" before any other player.</p>
             <p>Originally manufactured by <em>W.H. Storey & Co</em> in England and now by <em>Hasbro</em>, <strong>Sorry!</strong> is marketed for two to four players, ages 6 and up. The game title comes from the many ways in which a player can negate the progress of another, while issuing an apologetic "Sorry!"</p>

            <header>the Rules of Sorry</header>
            <article>
              <p><em>(As found in the 1939 United States version of the game Sorry!)</em></p>
              <p><strong>THE PACK</strong> consists of 44 cards, four each of the denominations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and four Sorry cards.</p>
              <p><strong>THE OBJECT</strong> of the game is for each player to move the 4 men under his control from his Start into his Home by moves governed by the cards he draws from the pack.</p>
              <p><strong>THE WINNER</strong> is the first player to move his 4 men into his Home.</p>
              <p><strong>THE START</strong> is made by shuffling the cards well and placing the pack face down on the center design on the board. Each player then draws a card from the pack. The player drawing the highest card is called the Leader. He chooses the color playing pieces that he wants and has the first play. The Sorry card counts the highest in drawing. The Winner of the first game is the Leader in the second game.</p>
              <p><strong>THE PLAY</strong> begins by the Leader drawing the top card from the pack and placing it face upward in the design marked on the board and moving his man according to the directions on the card that he has drawn. The player on the left of the Leader then draws the next card from the pack and so on, but no player may draw a card until the previous play has been completed.</p>
              <p><strong>TO START A MAN OUT</strong> a player places one of his men on the colored circle in front of his Start. A player must draw a No. 1, No. 2 or Sorry card for every man he Starts Out.</p>
              <p><strong>NOTE CAREFULLY</strong> that in playing either a No. 1 or No. 2 card to Start a Man Out the player merely places his man on the colored circle in front of his Start, but the player does not in addition move his man forward on that play.</p>
              <p><strong>MARGIN SQUARES</strong> are the 60 squares around the edge of the board. MARGIN MEN are those occupying any of the 60 Margin Squares.</p>
              <p><strong>SAFETY ZONE</strong> is the name given to the 5 COLORED SQUARES preceding each Home.</p>
              <p><strong>MEN IN PLAY</strong> are those occupying Any Margin Square or Any Square in the Safety Zone.</p>
              <p><strong>FORWARD MOVES</strong> are made in the directions indicated by the arrows.</p>
              <p><strong>The Pack:</strong> When the pack has been exhausted, reshuffle and place face down again on the board.</p>

            <ol type='A'>
              <li><em>Under No Circumstance Whatsoever</em> do two men occupy one square.</li>
              <li>If by <em>Any Move Whatsoever</em> a man ends its move on a <strong>Margin Square</strong> occupied by an opponent’s man, the opponent’s man Must be returned to its Start.</li>
              <li>A player <em>Forfeits the Move</em> for any card drawn if the <em>Only</em> move Open to him would cause him to move Onto a square already occupied by one of his <strong>Own Men</strong>, i.e., a player is <em>Never</em> compelled to return his own men to <strong>Start</strong> Except by <strong>Sliding</strong> under the <strong>Slide</strong> rule. (See Slide Rule, below.)</li>
              <li>A player may pass <em>Over</em> his own men or those of <em>Any</em> opponent, but <em>Every</em> Square on the board whether occupied or not must be counted.</li>
              <li>The <em>Exact</em> number must be drawn to move a man <strong>Home</strong> (see Amplified Card Rule “7”).</li>
              <li>A player <em>Forfeits</em> the move if he draws a card which would carry the <em>Only</em> man he has in play beyond his <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
              <li>The <strong>Safety Zone</strong> leading to a player’s Home is entered only by a man of the same color, from (or through) the square marked <strong>“Enters to Go Home.”</strong> (This entrance square is used otherwise like any other plain white square.) A <strong>Safety Zone</strong> may be entered only by a forward move and a player is never allowed to move his man forward beyond this entrance square except to enter his <strong>Safety Zone</strong>. (NOTE: However, this rule has no application to the exchange of pieces by an opponent through the play of an 11 card.)</li>
              <code><p>If a man is compelled by the play of a 4 or 10 card to move backwards from his <strong>Safety Zone</strong> he may pass backwards to (or through) this entrance square in the reverse direction of the arrow.</p></code>
             <code><p>Note also that a player in playing a 4, 10, 11 or <strong>Sorry</strong> card may be fortunate enough to place one of his men in a position to enter his <strong>Safety Zone</strong> on a subsequent play without playing all of the way around the board. For example, a player having a man on his Starting Circle immediately opposite his Start and drawing a No. 4 card may move that man four spaces backwards, thus placing it in a position to enter its <strong>Safety Zone</strong> by any subsequent forward move which would not carry it beyond its HOME.</p></code>
              <li>A player <em>Must</em> move one of his men the <em>Full</em> number of squares for <em>Every Card Drawn</em>, or make one of the alternate moves according to the Rules. If it is <em>impossible</em> to do either, the move must be <strong>Forfeited</strong>.</li>
              <li>Once a man has been moved into <strong>Home</strong> it is <strong>Out of Play</strong> and is <em>Not</em> moved again during the game.</li>

               <code><p>If as a result of any move whatsoever a player’s man <strong>Ends</strong> its move on any of the 6 colored triangles at the start of a <strong>Slide</strong>, other than a slide of its own color, it <strong>Must</strong> slide along the channel to the colored circle at the other end and remove <strong>EVERY</strong> man <strong>ON</strong> the Slide (even a man of its <strong>OWN</strong> color). Every man thus displaced must be returned to its respective <strong>Start</strong>. <em>Note very carefully</em> that a man does <strong>Not</strong> slide when it ends its’ move on a triangle of Its Own Color. </p></code>

           <article>
              <p>The following is in further explanation of the rules printed on the cards, which entirely govern the play of the game.</p>
              <p>A player drawing a 3, 5, 8, or 12 card moves forward the corresponding number of spaces, provided he has a man in play. If he cannot move the full number of spaces called for by the card he forfeits his move.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>THE 1:</strong> A player must either <strong>Start a Man Out</strong> or move one man, which is already in play, forward one square.</li>
                <li><strong>THE 2:</strong> A player must either <strong>Start a Man Out</strong> or move one man, which is already in play, forward two squares. The play for the “2” must be made before the extra draw is taken.</li>
                <li><strong>THE 4:</strong> A player who has a man in the Safety Zone and draws a “4” must move that <em>man backward 4 spaces if he has no other man in play.</em></li>
                <li><strong>THE 7:</strong> A player may move a man <strong>Home</strong> with a split “7”, provided he has another man in play to complete the full move of 7 squares in all. Providing the full 7 squares are moved, a split “7” may be used to move 2 men into <strong>Home</strong>, return 2 opponents’ men to <strong>Start</strong>, use <strong>2 Slides</strong>, or combination of any of the above. A “7” must not be used to <strong>Start a Man Out</strong> and must not be used to move a piece backward.</li>
                <li><strong>THE 10:</strong> A player drawing a “10” and being unable, or not wishing, to move a man forward 10 spaces <em>must</em> move a man <em>backward</em> 1 space even if that man is in the <strong>Safety Zone</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>THE 11:</strong> A player drawing an “11” <em>forfeits the move</em> if it is impossible for him to move one of his men forward 11 spaces and if he does <strong>Not Wish</strong> to change places with any <strong>Margin Men</strong> of an opponent.</li>
               </ul>

            <header>Partnership Sorry</header>
              <article>
              <p>Partnership Sorry is played in the same manner as regular <strong>Sorry</strong>.</p>
              <p>Red and Yellow are always partners. Green and Blue are always partners.</p>
              <p>A player after taking his turn at drawing a card from the pack may use this card for his own play or for that of his partner.</p>
              <p>Example: Red has four men at the start. Yellow, his partner has three men at Start and one on a margin square. Red draws a four card which he used to play Yellow’s man.</p>
              <p>A player may not forfeit a move if either he or his partner has a man that can be moved.</p>
              <p>In playing a partnership game, should it so happen that both of the players who are partners succeed in getting all of their eight men around the board and into their homes before either of the opposing players gets his four men home, the game immediately becomes a double game and is the equivalent of winning two single games.</p>

              <article>
              <ol>
                <li>A <strong>Sorry</strong> card must be used at all times, even though it may mean the removal of your partner’s man.</li>
                <li>If, as sometimes happens, the only possible move will land a player on a space occupied by his partner (when there is no other possibility of moving any other of his own or his partner’s men), the play must be made and the partner removed from the board.</li>
                <li>A seven may be split between any two men, including those of a partner.</li>
                <li>When a two is drawn, the extra draw may be applied to either your own or your partner’s men regardless of where the two was used.</li>
                <li>If none of your men are in a position to be moved, the play must be made by one of your partner’s men. Only in the case where neither your own men nor your partner’s men can be moved may the move by forfeited.</li>
                <li>When one player has all his men home, he continues to draw and uses all his moves for his partner’s men.</li>
                <li>The first set of partners to get all eight men in their proper homes wins the game.</li>

                  <h4>An Exciting Variation of Sorry</h4>
                  <p>The general rules for play in this game are the same as in regular <strong>Sorry</strong> with the following brief exceptions.</p>
                  <h4>BEGINNING PLAY:</h4>
                  <p>At the beginning of play <strong>five cards</strong> are dealt to each player. The remaining cards in the pack are placed <strong>face down</strong> in the center of the board. This becomes the <strong>Draw Pack</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Each player <strong>starts one man out</strong> on his own starting point.</p>
                  <h4>PLAY:</h4>
                  <p>The first player now begins play by playing <strong>one card</strong> from his hand and placing it <strong>face up</strong> alongside the draw pack in the center of the board. He then follows the directions printed on that card and moves as in regular <strong>Sorry</strong>. At the end of his move, he refills his hand by taking the <strong>top card</strong> from the draw pack. This completes that player’s move. (Note: No player may hold <strong>more or less</strong> than five cards in his hand at one time. If a player is unable to follow the directions on any card he holds, he is permitted to discard one card and take one card from the draw pile. His turn then ends.)</p>
                  <p>Play continues to the left, the Winner being that player who first gets <strong>all of his men Home</strong> by exact count.</p>
                  <h4>SCORING:</h4>
                  <p>At the end of the game each player scores <strong>one point</strong> for every man he has <strong>Home</strong> The Winner adds to his score of <strong>four</strong> points, <strong>one</strong> point for each opponent’s man in <strong>Home</strong>. This is called the <strong>Normal Score</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Twenty-Four additional points are added to the Winner’s <strong>Normal</strong> Score if no opponent has a man <strong>Home</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Sixteen points are added to the Winner’s <strong>Normal Score</strong> if no opponent has more than one man <strong>Home</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Eight points are added to the Winner’s <strong>Normal Score</strong> if no opponent has more than two men Home.</p>
                  <h4>DOUBLING:</h4>
                  <p>The Final Score in a <strong>Doubled Game</strong> is doubled. Any player may call “double” (or “redouble”) at any time in the game. Any or all other players may then accept the double (or redouble) or drop out of play. If all payers drop out on a double (or subsequent redouble) the game ends and the player who called the double (or redouble) wins five points.</p>

            <article>
              <p><strong>Patience Sorry</strong> is a game in which One player controls the moves of four red men and four yellow men, drawing for, and moving men on each color alternately. The object of Patience Sorry is to make fair moves according to the rules in such a manner that when two men of each color are <strong>Home</strong>, two of each color are in <strong>Safety</strong>. The game does not “come out” if the third man of one color enters <strong>Home</strong> before the fourth man of the other color has entered <strong>Safety</strong>.</p>

            <article>
              <p><em>(Adapted from the 1933 British version of the game Sorry!)</em></p>
              <p><strong>Don't Forget</strong> to control you excitement and not make the first move which appears good. First observe the effect of the move on all your men.</p>
              <p><strong>Don't Forget</strong> it may sometimes be to your ultimate advantage to delay an opponent who appears to be winning, rather than advance your own man.</p>
              <p><strong>Don't Forget</strong> that the game of Sorry is never lost until it is won. It is essentially a game of “ups and downs” and no two games are ever alike.</p>
